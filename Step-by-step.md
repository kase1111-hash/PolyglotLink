Foundation & Planning
- [x] Review spec sheet & confirm requirements
- [x] Define user stories & acceptance criteria
- [x] Choose tech stack & dependencies
- [x] Design architecture (system, data flow, API)
- [x] Initialize version control (Git)
- [x] Set up project structure (src/, tests/, docs/)
- [x] Define coding conventions & style guide
- [x] Create dependency manifest (package.json, requirements.txt)
- [x] Configure environment management (Docker, venv, etc.)
- [x] Write initial README.md

Core Implementation
- [x] Implement core logic per spec
- [x] Refactor for reusable components (DRY)
- [x] Add input validation & sanitation
- [x] Implement error handling
- [x] Add general logging
- [x] Add error logging (Sentry, ELK, etc.)
- [x] Secure configuration (.env or secrets manager)
- [x] Add command-line interface (if needed)
- [x] Build GUI or frontend (CLI application by design)
- [x] Add accessibility & localization support (CLI application)

Testing & Validation
- [x] Write unit tests
- [x] Write integration tests
- [x] Write system/acceptance tests
- [x] Add regression test suite
- [x] Conduct performance testing (load, stress)
- [ ] Perform security checks (input, encryption, tokens)
- [ ] Perform exploit testing (SQLi, XSS, overflow)
- [ ] Check for backdoors & unauthorized access
- [x] Run static analysis (lint, type check, vuln scan)
- [ ] Run dynamic analysis (fuzzing, runtime behavior)

Build, Deployment & Monitoring
- [x] Create automated build scripts (Makefile, .bat, shell)
- [x] Set up CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions, Jenkins, etc.)
- [x] Configure environment-specific settings (dev/stage/prod)
- [x] Build distributable packages (Dockerfile, zip, exe)
- [ ] Create installer or assembly file (.bat, setup wizard)
- [x] Implement semantic versioning (v1.0.0)
- [ ] Automate deployment process
- [x] Add telemetry & metrics collection
- [ ] Monitor uptime, errors, and performance
- [ ] Add rollback & recovery mechanisms

Finalization & Compliance
- [ ] Conduct manual exploratory testing
- [ ] Peer review / code audit
- [ ] Run penetration test (internal or 3rd-party)
- [x] Document APIs (Swagger / Postman)
- [ ] Create architecture & data flow diagrams
- [ ] Finalize user documentation (README, FAQ, troubleshooting)
- [x] Add license file
- [x] Write changelog
- [ ] Perform compliance review (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.)
- [ ] Tag release & archive build artifacts
